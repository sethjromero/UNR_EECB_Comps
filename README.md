# Welcome!

This repository was started to share and store resources related to preparation for EECB comprehensive exams.  At a minimum, this project should allow graduate students with different specialties to learn foundational ecology/evoluation topics collaboratively and organize that knowledge for future reference.  

This project is *student* run and is meant to be flexible, accessible, and shaped according to the needs/curiosities of *students*.  It can also be a place to discuss research projects, share analyses, or otherwise nerd out.  The value in this thing comes from your own creativity.

Before adding or editing content, please familiarize yourself with the three primers in the main directory:

+ Navigating Git and best editing practices (GitGuide.md) 
+ Intro to markdown formatting (MarkdownGuide.md)  
+ GitHub discussion forums (DiscussionsGuide.md)

Anyone with collaborator access is free to change content in here as they choose.  However, ***major*** organizational changes should be discussed with those working in directories that will be affected.  Discussion forums are a good place for this. <br>

To request collaborator access, email sethromero@nevada.unr.edu<br>

## General Rules

All text files in this repo are written in markdown (i.e. no word documents).  Markdown files are plain text and allow for much easier merging of different versions and tracking of editing history.<br>

GitHub is not intended to be a large data storage server.  However, it will likely be useful to embed pictures and graphics into topic guides.  These files will need to be stored in the associated directory (see MarkdownGuide for more), but please take into consideration file size and compression options where possible.  Use hyperlinks for references rather than storing full PDF files.  For UNR students, most journals are easily accessed off campus following these directions (see "proxy" directions UNR libary link). 

### I. Directories

Information in a given 

### II. Discussions

## Organization

Directories in this repository are organized based on current subjects of the EECB comprehensive exam [add link here to current question bank, UNR website]. Specifically, these are:

+ **Evolution**
    + add subtopics...
+ **Ecology**
    + add subtopics...
+ **Quantitive Methods/Statistics**
    + add subtopics...

Within each of these subject directories, you will find topic-specific information including foundational concepts, definitions, equations, figures, references, and anything else relevant to the topic.
