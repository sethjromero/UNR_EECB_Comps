# Welcome! :seedling: :butterfly: :sunflower: :frog: :lizard: :mosquito: :fish:

This repository was started to share and store resources related to preparation for EECB comprehensive exams.  At a minimum, this project should allow graduate students with different specialties to learn foundational ecology/evoluation topics collaboratively and organize that knowledge for future reference.  

This project is *student* run and is meant to be flexible, accessible, and shaped according to the needs/curiosities of *students*.  It can also be a place to discuss research projects, share analyses, or otherwise nerd out.  The value in this thing comes from your own creativity.

Before adding or editing content, please familiarize yourself with the three primers in the main directory:

+ Navigating Git and best editing practices [GitGuide](GitGuide.md) 
+ Intro to markdown formatting [MarkdownGuide](MarkdownGuide.md)  
+ GitHub discussion forums [DiscussionsGuide](DiscussionsGuide.md)

Anyone with collaborator access is free to change content in here as they choose.  However, ***major*** organizational changes should be discussed with those working in directories that will be affected.  Discussion forums are a good place for this. <br>

To request collaborator access, email sethromero@nevada.unr.edu<br>

## General Rules

All text files in this repo are written in markdown (i.e. no word documents).  Markdown is a simnple formatting language for plain text.  It is easy to learn and allows for easier version merging, edit tracking, and cross-platform compatibility.<br>

GitHub is not intended to be a large data storage server.  However, it will likely be useful to embed pictures and graphics into topic guides.  These files will need to be stored in the associated directory (see MarkdownGuide for more), but please take into consideration file size and compression options where possible.  Use hyperlinks for references rather than storing full PDF files.  For UNR students, most journals are easily accessed off campus following the **"proxy bookmarklet"** directions found [here](https://library.unr.edu/help/online-access). 

### I. Directories

Information in directories will inherently be works-in-progress, so it will be helpful to create an empty organizational structure that can be added to later.  This also allows others to see what information is missing.  Thoughts don't need to be fully formed to commit changes, but you might signal to others what sections you intend to edit later with unique formatting for comments or parenthetical remarks.

### II. Discussions

**Rule #1**- Be kind<br>
Really the only rule needed.  Any and everything is free to discuss.  Use `categories` and `tags` to keep things organized so others can easily find past discussions. 

## Organization

Directories in this repository are organized based on current subjects of the EECB comprehensive exam found [here](https://www.unr.edu/eecb/degrees/handbook/comp-exam). Specifically, these are:

+ **Ecology**
    + [Organismal Ecology](/Ecology/OrganismalEcology/)
    + [Population Ecology](/Ecology/PopulationEcology/)
    + [Species Interactions](/Ecology/SpeciesInteractions/)
    + [Community Ecology & Biogeography](/Ecology/CommunityEcologyBiogeography/)
    + [Ecosystem Ecology](/Ecology/EcosystemEcology/)
    + [Landscape Ecology](/Ecology/LandscapeEcology/)
    + [Global Change Ecology](/Ecology/GlobalChangeEcology/)
+ **Evolution**
    + [Natural Selection & Adaptation](/Evolution/NaturalSelectionAdaptation/)
    + [Macroevolution & Phylogenetics](/Evolution/MacroevolutionPhylogenetics/)
    + [Coevolution](/Evolution/Coevolution/)
    + [Population Genetics](/Evolution/PopulationGenetics/)
    + [Conservation Biology](/Evolution/ConservationBiology/)
+ **Quantitive Methods**
    + [Frequentist Statistics](/QuantitiveMethods/FrequentistStatistics/)
    + [Experimental Design](/QuantitiveMethods/ExperimentalDesign/)
    + [Modern Statistical Paradigms](/QuantitiveMethods/ModernStatisticalParadigms/)
    + [Modeling](/QuantitiveMethods/Modeling/)
    + [Philosophy of Science](/QuantitiveMethods/PhilosophyOfScience/)

Within each of these subject directories, you will find topic-specific information including foundational concepts, definitions, equations, figures, references, and anything else relevant to the topic.
