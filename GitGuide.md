# GitHub Guide

The purpose of this guide is the following is to provide some basic Git organizational concepts so that you can:

1. Be a competent collaborator and user of GitHub hosted respositories
2. Be able to  create GitHub repositories to meet personal organizational needs
3. (*Advanced!*) - Create and efficiently manage a collaborative project with versioning control 

This guide is meant to be accessible for people with no prior Git experience, and is aimed at use cases in **non**-computer sciences. This means that code and other files are considered in terms of statistical analysis workflow and are not part of some application or product development. I provide many organizational 'opinions' that are based around what I think works best in collaborative science with complex data/analyses. This can be done effectively with Git, but it was not its original purpose. As such, it has *many* advanced features and organizational structures that I will not discuss here but are relevant in the fields of computer science and software development.
